## Deployment 
### **Heroku**

This application was built using the Gitpod IDE and deployed via Heroku. Follow these instructions to recreate the deployment process:

**1. Prepare the required files**

In the terminal in your code editor, type:

```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

and then...

```
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
```

These commands create two new files in your root directory which Heroku needs to run the application. Ensure Procfile includes a capital P and there is no file extension. Please check your Procfile and remove the last blank line if there is one, to avoid problems when trying to run your app.

**2. Create the app**

- Go to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) and login to your account.
- Click 'New' and then 'Create new app'.
- Choose an app name and the region closest to you.

**3. Linking to GitHub**

- Within the deployment method, click 'GitHub'
- With your GitHub profile selected, type in your repo name and then search.
- Once found, click connect.

**4. Environment variables**

- Click on 'Settings' and then 'Reveal Config Vars'.
- Add the required key/value variables from your env.py file.

| Key          | Value              |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| IP           | 0.0.0.0            |
| PORT         | 5000               |
| SECRET_KEY   | YOUR_SECRET_KEY*   |
| MONGO_URI    | YOUR_MONGO_URI*    |
| MONGO_DBNAME | YOUR_MONGO_DBNAME* |

Values with * are your own values to be created.

**5. Deployment**

- Ensure your two files in step 1 are pushed to GitHub.
- Within the 'Deploy' tab of your Heroku app, click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'
- Just below this, click 'Deploy Branch'.
- Within a few minutes, Heroku should confirm your app has been deployed with a button to view it online.
